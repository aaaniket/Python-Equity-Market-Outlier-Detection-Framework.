# Python Equity Market Outlier Detection Framework.

The Python Equity Market Outlier Detection Framework is a comprehensive tool designed to empower investors and analysts with the ability to detect, analyze, and interpret anomalies in stock market data. Leveraging Python programming language and various data analysis techniques, this framework offers valuable insights into irregular patterns and behaviors within the stock market.

**Workflow:**
1. **Data Collection:** Real-time stock market data is gathered using the yfinance API, encompassing attributes such as adjusted close prices, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics.
2. **Visualization:** Visualization techniques, including line plots and scatter plots, are employed to visualize adjusted close prices and trading volumes over time, aiding in anomaly detection and trend analysis.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Statistical methods such as Z-score analysis are utilized to detect anomalies in adjusted close prices and trading volumes, highlighting significant deviations from expected behavior.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Anomalies across different stocks are consolidated, and a correlation matrix is computed to analyze relationships between anomalies, providing insights into interconnected behaviors within the stock market.
5. **Risk Evaluation:** Risk ratings are calculated based on the frequency and magnitude of anomalies detected for each stock, assisting investors in assessing risk and making informed investment decisions.

**Market Impact:**
